1. Preliminary Pivoting for Negative RHS
If any constraint row in the initial tableau has a negative RHS:

Identify the pivot column:
In the row with negative RHS, select any column with a negative entry (if none exists, the problem is infeasible).

Select the pivot row:
For the pivot column, compute the ratios of RHS to the pivot column entry for rows where the entry is positive. Choose the row with the smallest positive ratio.

Perform the pivot operation:
Update the tableau using Gaussian elimination to eliminate the negative RHS. Repeat until all RHS values are non-negative.
